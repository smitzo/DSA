/*You are given an array 
 of length 
. There are two empty arrays, 
 and 
. You have to put every element of 
 into either 
 or 
.

The score of an array is defined as the square of the sum of all of its elements. Find the minimum possible absolute difference between the score of 
 and 
.

Input Format:

The first line of input contains a single integer 
, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer 
, denoting the length of the array 
.
The second line of each test case contains 
 integers, denoting the elements of array 
.
Output Format:

For each test case, print the minimum possible absolute difference between the score of 
 and the score of 
.

Constraints:
