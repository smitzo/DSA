/* PROGRAM 2 Ticket Encoding Sequence
You are working at a ticketing company that generates unique ticket codes for various events. The ticket
codes are generated based on a specific encoding sequence.
The encoding sequence follows the recursive formula as described below:
1. The ticket code for the first ticket (ticket #1) is "A."
2. To generate the ticket code for the next ticket (ticket #2), you would use the ticket code for the
previous ticket (ticket #1). In this case, the ticket code for ticket #1 is "A," so the ticket code for ticket #2
is "1A" (one 'A').
3. For ticket #3, you would use the ticket code for ticket #2, which is "1A." Now, split it into the minimal
number of substrings, each containing exactly one unique character, i.e., "1" and "A." Now, use the
number of digits in each substring followed by the digit itself. So, for ticket # 3, the ticket code is "111A"
(three '1's and one 'A').
4. For ticket #4, you would use the ticket code for ticket #3, which is "111A." Split it into substrings with
unique characters: "111" and "A." Use the number of digits in each substring, followed by the digit itself.
Therefore, the ticket code for ticket #4 is "311A" (three '1's, one '3', and one 'A'). Continue this process to
generate the ticket codes for subsequent tickets.
Your task is to print the Nth ticket code.
INPUT
